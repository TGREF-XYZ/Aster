# Aster DEX – What’s the Deal? Intro, Review & Easy Airdrop Farming Tricks

## Aster DEX Introduction

Aster DEX is a decentralized contract trading exchange backed by Binance Labs, and it’s seen as one of the standout DeFi projects in 2025. The idea is simple yet pretty powerful: give users a way to trade crypto with stronger security, more transparency, and extra perks through reward programs.

The setup uses a two-point system: **Au points** (you earn these by staking mainstream cryptos) and **Rh points** (tied to contract trading). Aster also makes a name for itself by being the first DEX to work with USD1 in trading, which widens its appeal and liquidity. Even CZ, the former Binance CEO, has shown his support publicly, which boosts the project’s credibility.

Some highlights include:  
- Perpetual contract trading in a decentralized setup  
- Support for multiple blockchains like Arbitrum and BSC  
- Very low fees (0.01% on limit orders, 0.035% on market orders)  
- Rh points reward system  
- Trading interface with pro-level chart tools  
- Works smoothly on mobile

## Easy Airdrop Farming Tricks for $ASTER Stage

Stage 2 of $ASTER farming is closing in, with the deadline set for **October 5, 2025** — just about twelve days away from September 23. Over on X (Twitter), people are sharing quick and straightforward strategies that rack up Rh points without piling on too much risk. The main theme: farm steady, keep your holdings safe, and avoid overcomplicating the grind.

### 1. Delta-Neutral Hedging: Earn Points + Funding

**The Play:**  
- Buy $ASTER spot on Aster DEX.  
- Open a 1x short perpetual against it.  

These positions cancel each other out on price moves, but you still pick up:  
- Positive funding rates (~0.27% every 4 hours lately)  
- Full Rh points for volume and holding duration  

**Why It Works:**  
It’s a set-it-and-leave-it strategy. You farm both points and funding. One farmer dropped $10K and pulled $400 in 2.5 days. Larger players ($5K+) are pulling in 10K–50K Rh points weekly.  

**Pro Tip:** Keep trades open for 1–24+ hours to get time-based multipliers (up to 2x). Hedge on another DEX like Bybit if you want an extra safety net.  

**Bonus Yield:** Use $USDF as margin. That adds ~15–17% APY plus a 2x points multiplier — no trading needed, just hold and stake.  

---

### 2. Passive Holding: Stack Points Without Lifting a Finger

**The Play:**  
- Stake BNB into **$asBNB** (yield-bearing version).  
- Or hold **$USDF** as perp margin.  

Both give 9–15% APY plus extra Rh points (up to 2x).  

**Why It Works:**  
It’s hands-off farming. TVL already passed $300M+, and one $ASTER spot buy adds time-based credits.  

**Pro Tip:** Let this be at least half your farming bag. Teams report a 1.5x multiplier from this method alone.

### 3. Taker + Limit Order Combo: Cheap Volume, Double Points

**The Play:**  
- Use market (taker) orders for 2x Rh points.  
- Enter/exit with limit orders to avoid slippage and fees.  
- Run $2K–$5K weekly volume on BTC/ETH perps. Both wins and losses count.  

**Why It Works:**  
It’s light on volume targets, so no need to overtrade. Many automate with alerts. Stick to clean setups, and volume racks up fast.  

**Pro Tip:** Pay fees in $ASTER for a 5% discount. Big farmers are racking up $140M+ volume this way. Team trading can add another 10% rebate.  

---

### 4. Team Switching & Referrals: Stacking Multipliers

**The Play:**  
Join a team or create one. Add a referral code (like 99aDbf, 4c028f, 27EA7D) and you’ll see:  
- 1.3–1.5x points boost  
- 10% referral share (levels 1 & 2)  

**Why It Works:**  
No KYC, just link a code in Rewards. Bigger teams (2K+ members) multiply faster.  

**Pro Tip:** Switch teams mid-season if needed. Farmers suggest targeting 185+ members for exponential boosts.

### Quick Start: 5-Minute Setup

1. Sign up on [Aster DEX](https://www.asterdex.com/en/referral/5C47fb)
2. Sign up Promo Code: 5C47fb (Sign up with this code for bonuses and lower trading fees.)
3. Deposit BNB/USDT  
4. Transfer to Perp Wallet  
5. Bind a team code  

Weekly routine: run $2K volume + passive holds → earn 5K–20K points (~$8K–$34K at $1.70). Bigger accounts are farming six figures with just $5K.  

---

### Risks Worth Mentioning

- Gas fees ($1–5 each trade)  
- Funding rates flipping negative  
- PnL swings if hedges aren’t managed  

Start small (like $500) before scaling up.  

On X, farmers like **@leftcurvemaxing** and **@DeRonin_** call this the easiest free money since $HYPE. With **Stage 3 (spot trading)** launching on October 6, momentum is building fast.
